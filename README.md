#Space Warrior - README

Space Warrior is a free, open source multiplayer shooter which can be played in local networks as well as over the internet. 

Every Player is equipped with a space ship which he can use to move in the environment and fight against the other players in a last man standing gameplay mode. To do so, the player uses a laser gun which can fire two types of shots, a regular shot or a so-called "master shot", whereas the last one has a greater range and causes more damage, but also uses more ammo. 
We are currently refactoring the code and translating it, since the original version was written using German expressions and documentation. 
Our first aim is to implement stable server and client applications first, so that we can provide an alpha version of the game soon. 

After doing so, we will add more functionality, including an API for opponents powered by AI, thus some kind of single player mode as well as games between teams of players and teams of AI players would become possible. Furthermore, we want to improve graphics and provide several gameplay modes such as team last man standing (TLMS), death match (DM) and team death match (TDM). 

However, we would be glad if you could check out this site frequently to stay up-to-date and do not miss the coming releases.
